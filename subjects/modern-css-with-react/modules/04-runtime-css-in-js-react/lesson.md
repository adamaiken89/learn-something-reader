### How Runtime CSS-in-JS Works

Runtime CSS-in-JS (styled-components, Emotion) generates `<style>` elements at runtime. Every component render that changes styles triggers re-parsing.

Flow:
1. `styled.button` called — parses template literal CSS string
2. Generates unique class name (e.g., `sc-bdVaJa`)
3. Creates CSS rule string
4. Injects `<style>` tag into `<head>` (or appends to existing style tag)
5. Returns component with generated class

```tsx
// What you write:
const Button = styled.button`
  padding: 8px 16px;
  color: ${p => p.$variant === 'danger' ? 'red' : 'blue'};
`;

// What runs:
// 1. Parse template string with interpolated values
// 2. Hash to class name: sc-bdVaJa
// 3. Inject: <style>[data-styled="active"] .sc-bdVaJa { padding: 8px 16px; color: red; }</style>
// 4. Render: <button class="sc-bdVaJa">
```

> **Think**: Every time `$variant` changes, what happens to the injected styles?
>
> *Answer: styled-components generates a new class for each unique prop combination. If variant toggles between 'danger' and 'default', two style rules exist in DOM. CSS is never removed — it accumulates. Over many combinations, the style tag grows unbounded.*

### Bundle Cost Breakdown

Runtime CSS-in-JS adds two cost layers:

**1. Library runtime (~12-15 kB gzip)**

This is the JS engine that parses CSS strings, generates classes, and manages injection. Ships with every bundle — even pages with zero styled components pay for it if tree-shaking fails.

**2. Styled component definitions in JS bundle**

Each `styled.button\`...\`` is a JavaScript tagged template expression. The CSS string lives in the JS bundle:

```
Component A: "padding: 8px; color: blue;" → ~10kB source → ~3kB gzip in JS bundle
Component B: "padding: 16px; color: red;" → ~10kB source → ~3kB gzip in JS bundle
```

These strings could be in a `.css` file at zero bundle cost. With runtime CSS-in-JS, they ship as JS.

**Comparison for 100-component app:**
- CSS Modules: 0 kB runtime, ~15 kB CSS (separate file)
- styled-components: ~14 kB runtime + ~30 kB CSS strings in JS = ~44 kB

> **Think**: What happens to CSS bundle if a component is lazy-loaded with React.lazy?
>
> *Answer: styled-components injects into the global style tag — lazy loading doesn't isolate component styles. All styles merge into one growing style element. CSS Modules naturally code-split: lazy component's CSS loads only when the chunk loads.*

### ThemeProvider in React

styled-components uses React Context for theme propagation:

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components';

const theme = {
  colors: {
    primary: '#0366d6',
    background: '#ffffff',
  },
  space: { sm: '8px', md: '16px' },
};

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <Button />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}

// Button reads theme via props:
const Button = styled.button`
  background: ${p => p.theme.colors.primary};
  padding: ${p => p.theme.space.sm};
`;
```

Theme object is accessible in every styled component via `props.theme`. Theme changes trigger re-render of all consuming components.

**Tradeoff**: ThemeProvider couples every styled component to React Context. Your design system cannot work without a wrapping `<ThemeProvider>`. Consumers of your component library must install styled-components and wrap their app.

### SSR Hydration and RSC

**SSR problem**: styled-components generates class names differently on server vs client unless server-side rendering is configured with `StyleSheetManager` and server-side sheet extraction.

```tsx
// Next.js Pages Router needs:
import { ServerStyleSheet } from 'styled-components';
// Custom _document.tsx to collect and inject styles
// Without this: FOUC (flash of unstyled content) on every page load
```

**RSC incompatibility**: styled-components uses `createContext`, hooks, and DOM API — all unavailable in Server Components. Every styled component needs `"use client"`.

```tsx
"use client"; // Required for RSC
import styled from 'styled-components';

const Button = styled.button`
  padding: 8px;
`;

// This component cannot be a Server Component
// Its entire JS bundle ships to the client
```

> **Think**: In a Next.js App Router app with 80% RSC and 20% client components, where do styled components end up?
>
> *Answer: Forced into the 20% client bundle. You can't use styled components in your server-rendered product listing (80% of the app). They only work inside the "use client" boundary.*

### When Runtime CSS-in-JS Still Makes Sense in 2026

Four specific scenarios where the cost is worth paying:

**1. Existing codebase (500+ styled components)**

Migration cost dominates. Rewriting 500 styled components to CSS Modules saves ~14 kB runtime but costs weeks of engineering. For a mature app with no bundle size crisis, the ROI is negative. Strategy: stop using styled-components for new components (use CSS Modules/Tailwind). Replace old components opportunistically during feature work.

**2. Electron / desktop apps**

No SSR, no RSC, no slow networks. The runtime tax (14 kB in a 50 MB Electron bundle) is noise. Dynamic theming via prop interpolation is genuinely convenient. styled-components performs fine here.

**3. Design system with extreme variant counts (100+ variants)**

When a component has 100+ variant combinations (icon + size + color + state + density + border), runtime CSS-in-JS's dynamic class generation is simpler than maintaining CSS Modules with clsx chains. Evaluate Vanilla Extract recipes first — only fall back to runtime if the variant composability needs exceed what recipe() provides.

**4. Rapid prototype → production path where team already owns the cost**

If the prototype was built in styled-components and the team understands the tradeoffs (no RSC, SSR config needed), shipping as-is beats a rewrite. Accept the runtime cost as a known liability — document it for future migration.

**Scenarios where runtime CSS-in-JS is the WRONG choice:**

| Scenario | Why it fails |
|----------|-------------|
| New Next.js App Router app with RSC | Every styled component forces `"use client"` — defeats server components |
| Component library for external consumers | Forces all consumers to install styled-components as peer dependency |
| Performance-sensitive public-facing app | 14 kB runtime + CSS strings in JS bundle delays FCP on slow networks |
| Team doesn't know CSS-in-JS | Learning curve + legacy lock-in — team will be stuck maintaining it |
| SSR-heavy app without SSR config | FOUC on every page load until ServerStyleSheet is configured |

> **Think**: The CTO says "we use styled-components company-wide." You're starting a new product. Do you use it?
>
> *Answer: Depends. If the product uses App Router / RSC: push back — runtime CSS-in-JS forces client components, defeating RSC benefits. If SPA with no SSR: acceptable, bundle cost is the main concern.*

### Cost-Benefit Analysis for Legacy Migration

When deciding whether to migrate away from runtime CSS-in-JS:

| Factor | Favor migration | Favor staying |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Component count | <200 components | >500 components |
| RSC adoption | Planning to use App Router | Staying on Pages Router |
| Bundle size pain | CSS strings inflating JS bundle | Bundle is within budget |
| Team size | Small team, can refactor | Large team, coordination cost high |
| Performance budget | Sub-100kB FCP target | No strict performance budget |

**Incremental migration strategy:**
1. Stop using runtime CSS-in-JS for new components
2. Extract design tokens → CSS custom properties
3. Replace one leaf component at a time (leaf → parent → grandparent)
4. Remove runtime library when zero imports remain

This avoids the "big bang" rewrite while gradually eliminating the runtime cost.

### Emotion vs styled-components

| Aspect | styled-components | Emotion |
|--------|------------------|---------|
| Bundle | ~14 kB gzip | ~11 kB gzip |
| API | `styled.tag` only | `styled.tag` + `css` prop |
| SSR | Requires config | Better out-of-box |
| RSC | Incompatible | Incompatible |
| Community | Larger, more resources | Smaller, but actively maintained |
| 2026 trend | Declining new usage | Declining new usage |

Both face same fundamental limitation: runtime style injection is antithetical to React's RSC direction.

### Why This Matters

Runtime CSS-in-JS was the dominant approach from 2018-2022. Many existing codebases use it. Understanding its internals and costs helps you maintain legacy apps, evaluate migration, and defend decisions against "but styled-components is what we've always used."

---

### Common Questions

**Q: Does styled-components tree-shake unused components?**
A: Partially. The runtime library (~14 kB) tree-shakes poorly because it's a single module. Individual styled components tree-shake if not imported — but the runtime stays.

**Q: Can I use styled-components with Tailwind?**
A: You *can*, but mixing patterns is confusing. Each component uses one approach. Don't combine within one file.

**Q: What's the migration path from styled-components to zero-cost CSS?**
A: Incremental: new components use CSS Modules or Tailwind. Extract shared design tokens as CSS custom properties. Replace one component at a time. No rewrite.

## Examples

### Example 1: Themed Button

```tsx
import styled, { css } from 'styled-components';

const variants = {
  primary: css`background: #0366d6; color: white;`,
  danger: css`background: #d73a49; color: white;`,
  ghost: css`background: transparent; color: #0366d6;`,
};

const sizes = {
  small: css`padding: 4px 8px; font-size: 14px;`,
  large: css`padding: 12px 24px; font-size: 18px;`,
};

const Button = styled.button<{
  $variant?: keyof typeof variants;
  $size?: keyof typeof sizes;
}>`
  display: inline-flex;
  align-items: center;
  border: 1px solid transparent;
  border-radius: 6px;
  cursor: pointer;
  ${p => p.$variant && variants[p.$variant]}
  ${p => p.$size && sizes[p.$size]}
`;

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={appTheme}>
      <Button $variant="primary" $size="large">Submit</Button>
      <Button $variant="ghost">Cancel</Button>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

### Example 2: Migration Pattern (styled → CSS Module)

**Before:**
```tsx
const Card = styled.div`
  padding: 16px;
  background: ${p => p.theme.colors.surface};
  border-radius: 8px;
`;
```

**After:**
```tsx
import styles from './Card.module.css';

// Theme tokens → CSS custom properties on root (handled once)
function Card({ children }) {
  return <div className={styles.card}>{children}</div>;
}
```

Theming moves from ThemeProvider to CSS custom properties — same runtime cost, zero library dependency.

## Key Takeaways
- Runtime CSS-in-JS injects `<style>` at runtime — ~12-15 kB library + CSS strings in JS bundle
- ThemeProvider uses React Context — couples library to consumers
- RSC incompatible — every styled component needs `"use client"`
- SSR requires extra configuration to prevent FOUC
- Declining for greenfield 2026 — replaced by zero-runtime, CSS Modules, Tailwind
- Valid for: legacy codebases (500+ components), electron apps, extreme variants (100+)
- Wrong for: new RSC apps, component libraries, perf-sensitive public apps
- Migration: incremental — new components use zero-cost approach, replace leaf components first

---

## Common Misconception

**"styled-components has zero runtime cost because it generates static CSS at build."**

False. styled-components and Emotion are runtime engines.
- Tagged template literal `styled.button\`...\`` executes in browser
- CSS string parsing happens on every mount
- Style injection manipulates DOM
- Library runtime ships to every client

Zero-runtime CSS-in-JS (Vanilla Extract, Linaria) is the build-time approach. The names are confusing — distinguish by "does it execute in the browser?"
